                        <h3>The “Alma (Almost) Mater” Scholarship</h3>
                        <p>For students who bravely walked away from their first college experience, 
                            SCU offers the Alma (Almost) Mater Scholarship. The award amount is based 
                            on how far you made it before dropping out — the closer you were to graduating, 
                            the more we admire your timing. Simply submit proof of your previous enrollment 
                            and a brief essay explaining what made you say “no thanks” the first time.</p>

                        <h3>The “Dean’s List of Regret” Grant</h3>
                        <p>If your previous GPA was less than ideal but your determination is now sky-high, 
                            you may qualify for the Dean’s List of Regret Grant. This need-based grant is 
                            awarded to students who demonstrate academic growth, humility, and the ability 
                            to laugh at old report cards. We believe everyone deserves a shot at redemption 
                            — even if statistics say otherwise.</p>

                        <h3>The “Tuition Redemption Discount”</h3>
                        <p>Transferred more credits than you care to count? We get it. The Tuition 
                            Redemption Discount is available to those bringing leftover credits from another 
                            institution. We’ll evaluate your transcript, round up any half-points, and knock 
                            a little off your tuition bill for every “incomplete” you turn into a success 
                            story.</p>

                        <p>At Second Chance University, we believe education should be affordable, even if 
                            it’s your second go-around. Tuition is priced per course to accommodate flexible 
                            schedules and life’s unpredictability. Each class is a flat rate, with no hidden 
                            fees — unless you count the cost of coffee during late-night study sessions.</p>

                        <p>Before beginning your next chapter, students are required to pay a one-time 
                            Reinstatement Package fee — a combination of orientation materials, digital 
                            campus access, and a ceremonial “Welcome Back” mug. It’s our way of saying you’re 
                            officially part of the comeback crew.</p>
