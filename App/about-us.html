                <div id="aboveImage">
                    <p>Founded on the belief that education should never be a one-time opportunity, 
                        Second Chance University (SCU) is dedicated to providing accessible, practical, 
                        and affordable pathways for learners ready to redefine their academic journey. 
                        Whether you’re returning to complete what you started or starting fresh after 
                        life took you in another direction, SCU exists to meet you where you are — not 
                        where others think you should be.</p>    
                    <p>At SCU, we understand that success doesn’t always follow a straight line. Our 
                        programs are designed for working adults, career changers, and those who’ve 
                        faced barriers to traditional education. Through flexible online and hybrid 
                        courses, dedicated faculty mentors, and a supportive community of fellow “second 
                        chancers,” we make it possible to finish strong — no matter how you began.</p>

                    <p>What sets SCU apart isn’t just our inclusive mission, but our commitment to 
                        real-world learning. We partner with industry professionals and employers 
                        to ensure that every course builds the skills and confidence needed for today’s 
                        workforce. Our goal isn’t simply to hand you a diploma — it’s to help you 
                        rediscover your potential and take control of your future.</p>
                    <p>Every story deserves a comeback. At Second Chance University, we celebrate 
                        persistence, resilience, and the courage to start again. Because education 
                        isn’t about where you’ve been — it’s about where you’re determined to go next.</p>
